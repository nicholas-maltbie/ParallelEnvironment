# Parallel Environment

Final Project for CS6068:  Parallel Computing. FS 2019

Group:
* Samual Buzas
* Saylee Dharne
* Nicholas Maltbie

Attempt to create an environment with procedural terrain, boids, and clouds.

## Development Environment

We are going to use Unity v19.2.11f1. For full information on the development environment and how to setup for contributing, see [Development.md](Development.md)

## Project Goals

Our goal is to make a configurable environment with interactive components like boids and clouds. Here are a few images from Sebastian League's GitHub repositories that model what we would look to achieve
